- **Drag-and-drop reordering** with custom StepListWidget
- **Real-time validation** with error reporting
- **Signal-based architecture** for UI updates

#### 2. **StepListItem Class**
- **Custom list widget items** for sequence steps

### Main Application Integration (`sequencer_ui/sequencer_app.py`)

#### 1. **Updated SequencerMainWindow**
- **Full SequenceEditor integration** replacing placeholder content
- **Signal connections** for sequence events (changed, loaded, step selected)
- **Properties panel updates** with sequence and step information
- **Enhanced menu system** with validation and example loading
- **Toolbar integration** with new buttons (Example, Validate)

#### 2. **Event Handlers**

## Architecture Highlights

### 1. **Signal-Based Communication**
```python
sequence_changed = pyqtSignal()      # Emitted when sequence data changes
sequence_loaded = pyqtSignal(str)    # Emitted when sequence is loaded
step_selected = pyqtSignal(str)      # Emitted when step is selected
```

### 2. **Dynamic Widget Management**
- **Step widget caching** for performance
- **Automatic widget creation** based on step type
- **Parameter synchronization** with change detection
- **Memory management** with proper cleanup

### 3. **Drag-and-Drop Architecture**
- **Custom list widget** with internal move support
- **Signal emission** for reorder events
- **Index tracking** for accurate positioning
- **Visual feedback** during drag operations

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `sequencer_ui/sequence_editor.py` - Complete sequence editor implementation (696 lines)

### Modified Files
- `sequencer_ui/sequencer_app.py` - Updated main application with sequence editor integration
