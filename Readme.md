## PyUI and Sequencer UI for CERN \- MVP

This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) software design for the PyUI Python-based UI framework and the Sequencer UI GUI application, intended for CERN's particle accelerator operations. The goal is to provide a foundational understanding of the project's scope, core functionalities, and system architecture for initial development.

## **Product Requirements Document (PRD) for MVP**

### **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop PyUI, a Python-based UI framework utilizing PyQt, specifically tailored for accelerator-specific components. Built upon PyUI, the Sequencer UI will serve as a graphical application for editing and executing operational sequences within CERN's particle accelerator control domain. The MVP will focus on establishing the core framework capabilities and a basic, functional Sequencer UI.

### **Goals for MVP**

* **Establish PyUI Core:** Develop the fundamental components and structure of PyUI to support basic PyQt GUIs with a focus on ease of development for accelerator-specific elements.  
* **Functional Sequencer UI:** Create a Sequencer UI that allows users to define, save, load, and initiate simple operational sequences.  
* **Developer Adoption Support:** Provide initial examples and basic documentation for PyUI to facilitate its adoption by other developers.  
* **Modern Software Practices:** Integrate modern Python development practices (e.g., testing, version control) into the project.

### **Target Audience**

* **PyUI Developers:** Python developers at CERN who will use PyUI to build new GUI applications for accelerator control.  
* **Accelerator Operators:** Personnel responsible for defining, executing, and monitoring operational sequences of particle accelerators using the Sequencer UI.

### **User Stories (MVP)**

**As a PyUI Developer:**

* I can create a new PyQt application using the PyUI framework.  
* I can easily integrate a custom accelerator-specific UI component into my PyUI application.  
* I can find basic examples and documentation to understand how to use PyUI.

**As an Accelerator Operator using Sequencer UI:**

* I can create a new operational sequence.  
* I can add basic steps (e.g., "Set Parameter X to Value Y", "Wait for Event Z") to a sequence.  
* I can save an operational sequence to a file.  
* I can load an existing operational sequence from a file.  
* I can initiate the execution of a saved operational sequence.  
* I can view the status of a running sequence (e.g., "Executing Step 1", "Completed").

### **Functional Requirements (MVP)**

**PyUI Framework:**

* **F1.1:** Provide a base PyQt application structure.  
* **F1.2:** Offer a mechanism for registering and using custom UI widgets/components.  
* **F1.3:** Include basic examples demonstrating component usage.

**Sequencer UI Application:**

* **F2.1 Sequence Creation:** Allow users to create new, empty operational sequences.  
* **F2.2 Step Management:** Enable adding, reordering, and removing predefined basic sequence steps (e.g., SetParameter, WaitForEvent, Delay).  
* **F2.3 Parameter Configuration:** For each step, allow configuration of relevant parameters (e.g., parameter name, target value, event name, delay duration).  
* **F2.4 Save/Load:** Implement functionality to save sequences to a local file (e.g., JSON, YAML) and load them.  
* **F2.5 Execution Control:** Provide a "Run" button to initiate sequence execution.  
* **F2.6 Status Display:** Show the current status of the sequence execution (e.g., current step, overall progress).

### **Non-Functional Requirements (MVP)**

* **Performance:** The UI should be responsive and not freeze during operations. Sequence execution should be initiated promptly.  
* **Reliability:** The application should handle common user errors gracefully (e.g., invalid input).  
* **Usability:** The interface should be intuitive for operators to create and run sequences.  
* **Maintainability:** Codebase should be well-structured, commented, and follow Python best practices.  
* **Security:** (Minimal for MVP) Data stored locally should not contain highly sensitive information.

### **Out of Scope for MVP**

* User authentication or accounts.  
* Complex graphical sequence flow visualization (e.g., drag-and-drop flowcharts).  
* Real-time integration with accelerator hardware for direct control (MVP will simulate execution or use a simplified interface).  
* Advanced error handling and recovery mechanisms during sequence execution.  
* Comprehensive logging and reporting.  
* Multi-user collaboration on sequences.  
* Integration with external databases beyond local file storage for sequences.  
* Complex undo/redo functionality for sequence editing.

### **Possible Use Cases at CERN (MVP Focus)**

1. **Basic Machine State Configuration:** An operator needs to set a series of machine parameters to predefined values before an experiment. They use the Sequencer UI to create a sequence like:  
   * SetParameter(Magnet\_Current\_A, 100.5)  
   * SetParameter(RF\_Frequency\_B, 400.12)  
   * WaitForEvent(Beam\_Ready\_Signal) They save this sequence and execute it.  
2. **Automated Test Sequences:** A developer wants to run a series of diagnostic checks on a new component. They use PyUI to build custom test widgets, then use Sequencer UI to create a sequence that calls these tests:  
   * RunDiagnostic(Component\_X\_Test\_1)  
   * Delay(5\_seconds)  
   * RunDiagnostic(Component\_X\_Test\_2) They execute this sequence to automate testing.  
3. **Simple Beamline Tuning:** An operator needs to perform a routine tuning procedure involving a few steps. They use Sequencer UI to define:  
   * SetParameter(Steering\_Coil\_1, 0.5)  
   * WaitForEvent(Beam\_Position\_Stable)  
   * SetParameter(Quadrupole\_2, 1.2) This simplifies repetitive manual adjustments.

## **System Design Document**

### **Architecture Overview**

The system will primarily consist of a desktop application built using Python and PyQt. It will follow a modular design, separating the core PyUI framework from the Sequencer UI application logic. Data persistence for operational sequences will initially rely on local file storage.

### **Component Breakdown**

1. **PyUI Framework (Python, PyQt):**  
   * **Purpose:** Provides the foundational UI components and architectural patterns for building PyQt applications with accelerator-specific needs. It acts as a library that Sequencer UI (and other future applications) will import and utilize.  
   * **Key Modules/Classes:**  
     * PyUI.ApplicationBase: Base class for PyUI\-based applications, handling PyQt application setup.  
     * PyUI.Widgets: Contains common and potentially accelerator-specific PyQt widgets (e.g., ParameterInputWidget, EventMonitorWidget).  
     * PyUI.Layouts: Standardized layout patterns.  
     * PyUI.Utils: Utility functions for common UI tasks.  
   * **Interaction:** Sequencer UI will import classes and functions directly from PyUI.  
2. **Sequencer UI Application (Python, PyQt, leveraging PyUI):**  
   * **Purpose:** The main GUI application allowing operators to create, edit, save, load, and execute operational sequences.  
   * **Key Modules/Classes:**  
     * SequencerApp: The main application class, inheriting from PyUI.ApplicationBase.  
     * SequenceEditor: A PyQt widget responsible for displaying and allowing modification of sequence steps.  
     * StepWidgets: Individual PyQt widgets for each type of sequence step (e.g., SetParameterWidget, WaitForEventWidget, DelayWidget), which utilize PyUI.Widgets.  
     * SequenceExecutor: A non-UI component responsible for interpreting and "executing" the sequence steps. For MVP, this will be a simplified, simulated execution or a placeholder interface to the actual control system.  
     * FileManager: Handles saving and loading sequence data to/from the local file system.  
   * **Interaction:**  
     * Uses PyUI for its UI components and application structure.  
     * Reads from and writes to the Local File System for sequence persistence.  
     * Interacts with the Accelerator Control System Interface (simulated for MVP) to perform sequence actions.  
3. **Local File System:**  
   * **Purpose:** Stores operational sequences as structured data files (e.g., JSON or YAML).  
   * **Interaction:** Sequencer UI's FileManager component will perform read/write operations.  
4. **Accelerator Control System Interface (Simulated/Placeholder for MVP):**  
   * **Purpose:** Represents the actual interface to CERN's particle accelerator control system. For the MVP, this will be a simplified Python module that prints messages to the console or simulates delays, rather than connecting to real hardware.  
   * **Interaction:** Sequencer UI's SequenceExecutor will call methods on this interface to "execute" steps.

### **Interactions**

* **User to Sequencer UI:** The user interacts directly with the Sequencer UI through its graphical elements (buttons, text fields, lists).  
* **Sequencer UI to PyUI:** Sequencer UI instantiates and uses PyUI's base application classes, widgets, and utilities to construct its interface. PyUI provides the building blocks.  
* **Sequencer UI to Local File System:** When a user saves or loads a sequence, the Sequencer UI serializes/deserializes the sequence data and reads/writes it to a designated directory on the local machine.  
* **Sequencer UI (Executor) to Accelerator Control System Interface:** When the "Run" button is pressed, the SequenceExecutor iterates through the sequence steps. For each step, it calls a corresponding method on the Accelerator Control System Interface. In the MVP, this interface will merely acknowledge the call and potentially simulate an outcome or delay.

### **Data Flow & Scenarios (MVP Focus)**

**Scenario 1: Creating and Saving a New Sequence**

1. **User Action:** User launches Sequencer UI and clicks "New Sequence".  
2. **UI Interaction:** Sequencer UI displays an empty sequence editor.  
3. **User Action:** User adds steps (e.g., "Set Parameter X", "Delay") and configures their parameters using StepWidgets provided by PyUI.  
4. **Data Update:** The SequenceEditor component in Sequencer UI maintains an in-memory representation of the sequence (e.g., a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a step and its parameters).  
5. **User Action:** User clicks "Save".  
6. **File Manager:** Sequencer UI's FileManager takes the in-memory sequence data.  
7. **Serialization:** The FileManager serializes the sequence data (e.g., to JSON or YAML string).  
8. **File Write:** The FileManager writes the serialized string to a file on the Local File System (e.g., my\_sequence.json).

**Scenario 2: Loading and Executing an Existing Sequence**

1. **User Action:** User launches Sequencer UI and clicks "Load Sequence".  
2. **File Dialog:** Sequencer UI opens a file dialog, allowing the user to select a sequence file from the Local File System.  
3. **File Read:** Sequencer UI's FileManager reads the selected file.  
4. **Deserialization:** The FileManager deserializes the file content back into an in-memory sequence data structure.  
5. **UI Update:** The SequenceEditor component in Sequencer UI populates its display with the loaded sequence steps and their configurations.  
6. **User Action:** User clicks "Run".  
7. **Executor Activation:** Sequencer UI's SequenceExecutor receives the in-memory sequence data.  
8. **Step Iteration:** The SequenceExecutor iterates through each step in the sequence.  
9. **Simulated Execution:** For each step, the SequenceExecutor calls the corresponding method on the Accelerator Control System Interface (e.g., interface.setParameter("X", 100\)). For MVP, this interface will just print a message like "Simulating: Setting Parameter X to 100".  
10. **Status Update:** The Sequencer UI updates its status display to show the currently executing step.  
11. **Completion:** Once all steps are processed, the Sequencer UI updates the status to "Sequence Completed".

### **Tech Stack Rationale (MVP Focus)**

Given the job description's explicit mention of Python and PyQt, these are the core technologies. For the MVP, the focus is on a self-contained desktop application, minimizing external dependencies.

* **Programming Language:**  
  * **Python 3:** The primary language as required by the job description.  
* **UI Framework:**  
  * **PyQt:** The specified UI toolkit for building the graphical interface.  
* **Libraries:**  
  * **PyTest:** (From your tech stack) Essential for unit and integration testing of both PyUI components and Sequencer UI logic, ensuring robustness.  
* **Data Persistence:**  
  * **Local File System (JSON/YAML):** For MVP, storing sequences as simple text files (JSON or YAML) is sufficient and avoids introducing external database complexities. Python's built-in json module or a lightweight YAML library can handle this.  
* **Version Control:**  
  * **Git/GitHub:** Standard for collaborative development and managing code changes.
