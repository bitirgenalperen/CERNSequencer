File Manager Module

This module handles saving and loading sequence data to/from the local file system.
Currently a placeholder for Milestone 1 - full implementation planned for Milestone 2.

The FileManager will be responsible for:
- Serializing sequence data to JSON/YAML format
- Deserializing sequence data from files
- Managing file dialogs for save/load operations
- Handling file format validation and error recovery

# Future implementation notes for Milestone 2:
#
# The full FileManager implementation will include:
# 1. JSON and YAML serialization/deserialization
# 2. PyQt file dialogs for save/load operations
# 3. File format auto-detection and validation
# 4. Error handling and recovery for corrupted files
# 5. Recent files management with persistent storage
# 6. Automatic backup creation before overwriting
# 7. File watching for external changes
# 8. Import/export functionality for different formats
# 9. Sequence metadata management (creation date, version, etc.)
# 10. Integration with the main application's file menu
