Sequence Editor Module

This module will contain the UI logic for editing sequences within the Sequencer UI.
Currently a placeholder for Milestone 1 - full implementation planned for Milestone 2.

The SequenceEditor will be responsible for:
- Displaying sequence steps in an editable format
- Managing the in-memory sequence data structure
- Providing UI for adding, removing, and reordering steps
- Integrating with step widgets for parameter configuration

#
# The full SequenceEditor implementation will include:
# 1. QListWidget or QTreeWidget for displaying sequence steps
# 2. Integration with step widgets from step_widgets module
# 3. Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering steps
# 4. Context menus for step operations
# 5. Real-time validation of step parameters
# 6. Undo/redo functionality (if time permits)
# 7. Step highlighting and selection management
# 8. Integration with FileManager for save/load operations
